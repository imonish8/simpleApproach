This repository contains my first attempt at creating a payment gateway page using only Vanilla HTML and CSS. The page is designed to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to make payments.

### Features:

1. **Clean and Simple Design**: The page features a clean and minimalist design to ensure ease of use for users.

2. **Payment Form**: A payment form is included where users can input their payment details such as card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing address.

3. **Validation**: Basic validation is implemented to ensure that users enter valid information before submitting the payment form.

4. **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### Usage:

To use this payment gateway page:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the payment page.

3. Input your payment details into the form fields.

4. Submit the form to process the payment (Note: This is a demo page and does not process actual payments).

### Customization:

The HTML and CSS code provided can be easily customized to suit your specific needs and preferences. You can modify the layout, colors, fonts, and content as desired.
